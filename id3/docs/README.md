# Decision Tree and ID3 Algorithm Documentation

This code defines functions for building a decision tree using the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm and making predictions with the trained decision tree.

## Class: DecisionTreeNode

### Constructor

#### `DecisionTreeNode(attribute, value, branches, classification)`

Creates a new instance of the `DecisionTreeNode` class representing a node in the decision tree.

- `attribute` (string): The attribute being tested at this node.
- `value` (any): The value of the attribute that leads to this node.
- `branches` (Array): An array of tuples containing the value and the child subtree for each possible branch.
- `classification` (any): The classification at this node (if it's a leaf node).

## Function: id3

### `id3(examples, attributes, targetAttribute)`

Performs the ID3 algorithm to build a decision tree for the given examples and attributes.

- `examples` (Array): An array of objects representing the training examples. Each object contains attribute-value pairs.
- `attributes` (Array): An array of strings representing the names of the attributes available for splitting.
- `targetAttribute` (string): The name of the target attribute to be predicted by the decision tree.

Returns:
- A decision tree in the form of a `DecisionTreeNode`.

## Function: entropy

### `entropy(examples, targetAttribute)`

Calculates the entropy of a set of examples with respect to the target attribute.

- `examples` (Array): An array of objects representing the training examples. Each object contains attribute-value pairs.
- `targetAttribute` (string): The name of the target attribute.

Returns:
- The entropy value as a number.

## Function: predict

### `predict(example, tree)`

Makes a prediction using the trained decision tree.

- `example` (Object): An object containing attribute-value pairs for the example to be predicted.
- `tree` (DecisionTreeNode): The trained decision tree.

Returns:
- The predicted classification for the given example.
