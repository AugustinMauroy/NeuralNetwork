# Decision Tree Learning with ID3 Algorithm

This code implements the ID3 algorithm for decision tree learning in JavaScript. The ID3 algorithm is a popular algorithm for building decision trees from a dataset of examples with known classifications. The decision tree can then be used to predict the classification of new examples.

## Usage

To use the code, you need to provide a dataset and a target attribute to train the decision tree. You can then use the predict function to predict the target attribute for new examples.
